<font face=consolas size=3>I am currently a senior undergraduate student School of Computer and Data Engineering, NingboTech University(浙大宁波理工学院). I have participated in some scientific research projects about AIGC at Zhejiang lab. In the future, my research interests include large models and 3D reconstruction.<br /><br />
During my undergraduate studies, I participated in my university's programming competition team. Throughout my three years of competition experience, I won several awards. This experience laid a solid foundation for my programming skills. In the future, I would like to continue my studies and complete a master's degree on a higher level platform. I also want to contribute my strengths to the field of artificial intelligence.<br /><br />
